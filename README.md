# HL2DM Enhancements Pack

A collection of client-side optimizations and fixes for Half-Life 2: Deathmatch. This repository was originally part of the [Deathmatch Core Redux](https://github.com/Xeogin/xeogin.github.io) project and has since been separated to provide player-specific enhancements in a standalone package.

## Installation

1.  Download the `_hl2dm_enhancements_by_xeogin.vpk` and place it in your Half-Life 2: Deathmatch installation's `custom` directory. This is commonly located within:
    `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life 2 Deathmatch\hl2mp\custom`

2.  **Important:** If you have other content in your `custom` directory, confirm that there are no **`valve.rc`** files to ensure full functionality. If any exist, you should either delete them or merge their contents into your `autoexec.cfg` file.
